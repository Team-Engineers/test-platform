                  When Europeans, beginning with Columbus, entered the New World
                  in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, there were a number
                  of things they didn’t pause to appreciate before commencing
                  with the pillaging. One is that they had happened upon a rare
                  and precious natural experiment. The ancestor of native
                  Americans had migrated from northeast Asia during the late
                  Stone Age, the ‘Upper Paleolithic’. Then, around 10,000 B.C.,
                  with the climate warming, the land they’d walked across was
                  deluged by the Bering Sea. The Old World and the New World
                  were now two distinct petri dishes for cultural evolution. Any
                  basic trends inherent in the process should be evident in
                  both.{" "}

                  The experiment wasn’t perfect. Certainly by 2,000 B.C., and
                  possibly earlier, the Eskimos (also known as the Inuit) had
                  boats. Though paddling across the Bering Sea wasn’t the kind
                  of thing you would do for weekend recreation, and travel from
                  one Alaskan village to another was often arduous, there now
                  existed the theoretical possibility for innovations to move
                  glacially from Asia into North America. Still, for most of
                  prehistory, cultural changes in the New World appear to have
                  been indigenous, and even during the last few thousand years,
                  contact with the Old World was tenuous. The two hemispheres,
                  west and east, are the closest things to huge, independent
                  examples of ongoing cultural change that this planet has to
                  offer.

                  There is one other reason that primitive American cultures are
                  so enlightening. As of Columbus’s voyage, they had an
                  advantage over primitive Eurasian societies as objects of
                  study. Namely, they still existed; they had not been
                  steamrolled by the expansion of Old World civilizations. And,
                  though Columbus and other Europeans tried to make up for lost
                  time with their own steamrolling, they were not wholly
                  effective. Observed and recorded in the New World was an
                  unprecedented array of cultures, with diverse technologies and
                  social structures. From this diversity a few basic patterns
                  emerge, patterns that turn out to be consistent with the
                  archaeological remains of those steamrolled Old World
                  cultures. Native American cultures thus offer unique evidence
                  of the universal impetus toward cultural complexity.{" "}
